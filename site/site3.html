            <h2><b>Haruko Takahashi </b></h2>
            <p>
                Haruko Takahashi was a Shintō priestess who spent part of World War II imprisoned at Honouliuli Internment Camp on O’ahu, Hawai’i. She was born on April 19, 1910 in Kohala on Hawai’i Island to parents who had immigrated from Japan. Takahashi was a Nisei who held dual citizenship. She lived in Hawai’i when it was a territory of the United States between 1898 and 1959, before seeing the establishment of Hawai’i as a state in 1959. Takahashi’s journey to becoming a Shintō priestess started when she was a teenager. Growing up, Takahashi had poor eyesight that could not be addressed by surgery. She credits her introduction to the Konkokyo (or Konko) religion, a sect of ancient Japanese Shintōism, with the miraculous recovery of her eyesight at the age of seventeen.2 By January 14, 1940, Takahashi had established the Konko Mission of Wahiawa on O’ahu, a branch of the Church of Konko Mission of Honolulu. Just under two years later, World War II changed her life completely.

                On December 7, 1941, the Japanese military attacked the Pearl Harbor Naval Base on O’ahu, leading the United States to enter World War II. Almost immediately, martial law was declared in Hawaii and government officials started to round up residents suspected of harboring ill intentions against the United States. A vast majority of the eight hundred residents of Hawaii who were initially assembled, were of Japanese descent, and many were community leaders like Takahashi. The detainees were confined in various existing facilities located on the six major Hawaiian islands and eventually moved to, the U.S. Immigration Station and Sand Island Detention Camp. Many detainees also were sent to mainland Department of Justice and War Relocation camps. The opening of Honouliuli Internment Camp in 1943 provided an alternative to moving detainees to the mainland that was more permanent and isolated.3
